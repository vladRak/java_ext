hw_1.

FibonacciNumbers:
Implement a program, which generates a set of N fibonacci numbers. Find the largest odd/even fibonacci number. Find the percentage of odd/even numbers.

SequenceOfRange:
Implement a program, which accepts a range from a user (like [1, 100]). Print all odd numbers from this range from the beginning to the end of a sequence. Print all the even numbers from the end to the beginning of the sequence. Calculate the sum of all the odd/even numbers from the sequence.

hw_2.

Create an application that meets the requirements given in the task. Inheritance apply only in those tasks in which it is logically
justified. To argue that each class being created belongs to a class.
method and correctly override for each class methods equals (),
hashCode (), toString ().
Create a hw_2.Computer class object using Winchester classes
Drive, RAM, Processor. Methods: turn on, turn off
read, check for viruses, print the size of the hard drive to the console.

hw_3.

Vehicles:
implement a Vehicle class. Implement a set of derived classes - Car, Plane, Ship. Implement a BatMobile class. A user can provide speed, price, coordinates and production year for any vehicle. The user also may provide a number of passengers for both plane and ship, height of flight for the plane and port for the ship. Find:
1. the fastest vehicle;
2. vehicle with the lowest price;
3. all vehicles with speed in range 200..500 but not planes;
4. quantity of planes produced after 2000 year with height of 5000;

hw_4.

Calculator:
implement a program, which accepts a String, representing an arithmetic expression in infix notation, as its input parameter, performs the necessary sintactic checks and calculates the result.

Implement a stack/queue/any other ADT yourself if such a data structure should be used in your program.
